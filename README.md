# Covid-19 Analysis: Spread, Containment and Future steps

Since the Ebola outbreak in 2014, there were number of alarms raised worldwide by scientists, healthcare experts and even enterpreneurs like Bill Gates about a potential pandemic that could wreak havoc on our world. But did the countries listen?

In this project, we will try to figure out the same answer. The key questions which we would look to answer:

* Which Countries have invested more in their healthcare since 2015?
* Have these Countries been less impacted by Covid Pandemic as compared to others(in terms of deaths,number of recovered patients)?
* Which Countries have been the most strict and at the same time effective in containing this pandemic?
* What are the long term solutions going forward - A Complete lockdown or Better Healthcare Facilities?

The data which I am going to use for this project is:

* Covid-19 Cases Worldwide dataset (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset)
* Mitigation Measures taken by Countries (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/covid19-containment-and-mitigation-measures)
* World Developement Indicators from 2015-2018 (Source: http://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/topic/8?downloadformat=csv)
